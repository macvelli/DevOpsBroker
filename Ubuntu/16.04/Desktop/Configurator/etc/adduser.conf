# The DSHELL variable specifies the default login shell on your system
DSHELL=/bin/bash

# The DHOME variable specifies the directory containing users' home directories
DHOME=/home

# If GROUPHOMES is "yes", then the home directories will be created as
# /home/groupname/user
GROUPHOMES=no

# If LETTERHOMES is "yes", then the created home directories will have an extra
# directory - the first letter of the user name. For example:
# /home/u/user.
LETTERHOMES=no

# The SKEL variable specifies the directory containing "skeletal" user files;
# in other words, files such as a sample .profile that will be copied to the
# new user's home directory when it is created.
SKEL=/etc/skel

# FIRST_SYSTEM_[GU]ID to LAST_SYSTEM_[GU]ID inclusive is the range for UIDs
# for dynamically allocated administrative and system accounts/groups.
# Please note that system software, such as the users allocated by the base-passwd
# package, may assume that UIDs less than 100 are unallocated.
FIRST_SYSTEM_UID=100

FIRST_SYSTEM_GID=100
LAST_SYSTEM_GID=999

# FIRST_[GU]ID to LAST_[GU]ID inclusive is the range of UIDs of dynamically

# The USERGROUPS variable can be either "yes" or "no".  If "yes" each created
# user will be given their own group to use as a default.  If "no", each
# created user will be placed in the group whose gid is USERS_GID (see below).
USERGROUPS=yes

# If USERGROUPS is "no", then USERS_GID should be the GID of the group 'users'
# (or the equivalent group) on your system.
USERS_GID=100

# Set the DIR_MODE to 0750 drwxr-x---
DIR_MODE=0750

# If SETGID_HOME is "yes" home directories for users with their own group the
# setgid bit will be set. This was the default for versions << 3.13 of adduser.
# Because it has some bad side effects we no longer do this per default. If you
# want it nevertheless you can still set it here.
SETGID_HOME=no

# If QUOTAUSER is set, a default quota will be set from that user with
# 'edquota -p QUOTAUSER newuser'

# If SKEL_IGNORE_REGEX is set, adduser will ignore files matching this regular
# expression when creating a new home directory
SKEL_IGNORE_REGEX="dpkg-(old|new|dist|save)"

# This is the list of groups that new normal users will be added to
EXTRA_GROUPS="cdrom audio video plugdev users"

# If ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS is set to something non-zero, the EXTRA_GROUPS option
# above will be default behavior for adding new normal users
