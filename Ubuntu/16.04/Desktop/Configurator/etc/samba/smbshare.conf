# Developed on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS running kernel.osrelease = 4.15.0-34
#
# This configuration file is included at the very end of /etc/samba/smb.conf so
# that any changes made by the DevOpsBroker script configure-samba.sh in the
# future do not blow away your share definitions.
#
# This file is blank by default. Shares can be added either manually or with
# the DevOpsBroker smbshare administrative utility.
