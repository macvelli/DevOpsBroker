desktop-configurator - A complete turn-key solution for configuring a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop

HISTORY

	As a casual user of Ubuntu Desktop for many years, it has often been a
	struggle to configure a new installation. Each Ubuntu version has a different
	way of doing the same thing, whether it be provide firewall services (UFW) or
	start services at bootup (systemd).

	Many guides/FAQs/Q&A on the Internet are obsolete based upon Ubuntu versions
	from many years ago. This only complicates things further when attempting to
	configure a recent Ubuntu version.

	Instead of creating yet another guide/FAQ/Q&A site that will eventually
	become outdated, the Ubuntu Desktop Configurator was created instead. It is
	specifically designed to bring a fresh installation of Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop
	up and running at its full potential given the hardware environment of the
	end user.

	Well over a thousand hours have been put into making the Ubuntu Desktop
	Configurator a reality. Countless sites have been poured over to curate the
	best possible automated solution given the baseline that the Ubuntu 18.04
	LTS release provides. A baseline that is guaranteed to be supported by
	Canonical until April 2021.

	The ultimate goal is for end users to enjoy their Ubuntu Desktop experience
	with the absolute minimum amount of time necessary to configure it. It
	should take less than an hour to go from downloading the latest ISO found
	on http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/, installing it, and configuring with
	Ubuntu Desktop Configurator.

	There is plenty of room for additional configurations and customizations once
	the base configuration process is complete. But the real benefit is you can
	become productive virtually immediately with whatever it is you want to use
	Ubuntu Desktop for (website design, software development, office apps, email,
	calendar, music, photos, videos, etc).
