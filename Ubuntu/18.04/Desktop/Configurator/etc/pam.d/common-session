# Developed on Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS running kernel.osrelease = 4.15.0-45
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define tasks to be performed
# at the start and end of sessions of *any* kind (both interactive and
# non-interactive).
#
# As of pam 1.0.1-6, this file is managed by pam-auth-update by default.
# To take advantage of this, it is recommended that you configure any
# local modules either before or after the default block, and use
# pam-auth-update to manage selection of other modules.  See
# pam-auth-update(8) for details.

# Query file/directory mode creation mask:

#

# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
session	[default=1]			pam_permit.so

# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
session	requisite			pam_deny.so

# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
session	required			pam_permit.so

# The pam_umask module will set the umask according to the system default in
# /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different
# umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc.
# See "man pam_umask".
session optional			pam_umask.so umask=022

# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
session	required	pam_unix.so
session	optional	pam_systemd.so

# end of pam-auth-update config
