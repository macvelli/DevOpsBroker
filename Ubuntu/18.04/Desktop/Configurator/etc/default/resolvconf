# Developed on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS running kernel.osrelease = 4.15.0-33
#
# The default resolvconf behavior is to stop processing DNS servers after a
# loopback address entry is encountered.
#
# The problem is that there are *two* loopback addresses, one for IPv4 and
# another for IPv6. So naturally the IPv4 loopback address gets generated while
# the IPv6 loopback address does not.
#
# Gotta love Linux.
