# This APT preferences file is an example of how to backport select packages from
# newer Ubuntu releases into older ones by using Pin-Priority.
#
# In this example packages are referenced from Ubuntu 19.04 Disco for Ubuntu
# 18.04 Bionic.
#
# CRITICAL: You must use this file in conjunction with /etc/apt/sources.list.d/disco.list
# in order for this to work properly:
#
# 1. Copy this file into the /etc/apt/preferences.d directory
# 2. Copy the disco.list file into the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory
# 3. Modify this file according to whatever packages you want to backport into
#    Bionic
# 4. sudo apt update (pull Disco package information)
# 5. Check if the package pinning policy worked
#    - apt-cache policy boinc (should be pointing to the Disco version)
#    - apt-cache policy libc-bin (should be pointing to the Bionic version)
# 6. Assuming package pinning is working, you will most likely need to test the
#    install of the Disco package to look for any dependencies that also need
#    to be backported. USE YOUR OWN DISCRETION as backporting a package like
#    libc-bin will lay your Bionic install to waste.
# 7. sudo pms test boinc (performs a dry run without actually installing anything)
