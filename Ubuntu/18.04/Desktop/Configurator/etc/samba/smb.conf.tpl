# Developed on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS running kernel.osrelease = 4.13.0-43
#
# Samba Version 4.3.11-Ubuntu
#
# Due to the vulnerabilities in the SMBv1 protocol:
#   o Only SMBv2 and SMBv3 are supported
#   o NetBIOS is disabled
#   o Samba only listens on port 445
#
# Because of this, browsing for Windows Network servers will not work in
# Nautilus as it uses the SMBv1 protocol to look for other SMB shares on the
# network.
#
# The Samba server can be accessed using:
#   o The IP address of the server (smb://192.168.1.123/)
#   o By mDNS convention (smb://hostname.local/)
