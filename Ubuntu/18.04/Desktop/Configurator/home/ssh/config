# Developed on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS running kernel.osrelease = 4.13.0-45
#
# ssh obtains configuration data from the following sources in the following
# order:
#
#   1. Command-line options
#   2. User's configuration file (~/.ssh/config)
#   3. System-wide configuration file (/etc/ssh/ssh_config)
#
# The way ssh interprets the Host definitions from this configuration file
# means that:
#   o The most specific Host configurations need to be at the top of the file
#   o More general definitions must come later on in order to apply options
#     that were not already defined previously
